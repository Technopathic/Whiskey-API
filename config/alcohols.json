A few minutes in the glass lets the nose open up nicely. A distinct woodiness sits in the background.","palate":"Quite tannic and fairly peppery, with a heavily woody flavor profile. A hint of maple is noticeable, but more than anything, what stands out is the dry, tongue-coating mouthfeel.","finish":"Oak predominates on a long, but drying, nearly hot finish.

Barrel char and sawdust find secondary notes in modest vanilla and a cinnamon-raisin character, almost like a toasted slice of buttered raisin bread.","palate":"The body plays up some of this, with fruity notes coming on strong up front. Notes of rum raisin, vanilla ice cream, baking spice, and classically toasty, burnt caramel-focused bourbon character come together to make for a relatively straightforward spirit with just a touch of variety.","finish":"The finish is sweet, returning to that raisiny-fruity character for a relatively quick denouement.","country":"USA","created_at":"2017-10-28 04:56:04","updated_at":"2017-10-28 04:56:04"},

The vanilla is a bit subdued, but when it appears it's a nice surprise.","palate":"Along with the corn and rye is a big dose of caramel followed by hints of toffee, burnt sugar (br\u00fbl\u00e9), honey, cinnamon and pepper. There are some hints of dark fruit and, again, subdued vanilla and a nice oaky underpinning to the entire flavor.","finish":"Long woody finish punctuated by caramel, toffee, under ripe citrus and vanilla.","country":"USA","created_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:38","updated_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:38"},

Following that are some great notes of smoky char, oak, strawberry shortcake and a mild astringency that I usually find with high rye bourbons.","palate":"Caramel, oak, and vanilla start things out. Accompanying these main three is a very robust spice filled with paprika, pepper, and cinnamon. There's some orange zest, light crisp fruit and cherries as well.","finish":"That same slightly dry \/ dusty character follows through on the long woody finish with some caramel and citrus. Very consistent aftertaste as it fades on a long finish.","country":"USA","created_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:39","updated_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:39"},

It's a very pleasant aroma.","palate":"On the palate the notes flip around a bit with the rye and wood leading the procession of dark fruit, caramel, citrus, cinnamon, leather and a hint of vanilla. Again, it's very pleasant and being rather similar to the Four Roses Small Batch it's hard not to like it.","finish":"It has a long woody finish that is punctuated with notes of rye, pepper and caramel coffee syrup.","country":"USA","created_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:39","updated_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:39"},

A touch of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and red licorice.","palate":"The Spice on the palate comes roaring out. Cinnamon, cloves, honey, a light peppery pop, some buttery toffee and a smooth caramel underpinning. There is a hint of mint, but it's not so much the flavor of mint as the sensation of mint.","finish":"Cloves and pepper fade to a slight grapeyness which fades to a woody rye spice that lingers.","country":"USA","created_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:40","updated_at":"2017-10-28 05:11:40"},

Inside that wrapper is caramel with some honey and graham cracker. Under these lie some hints of corn, vanilla and a touch of tropical fruit and a very light rye. Much lighter rye notes in the nose than any of the small batch or single barrel bottles I've had.","palate":"Here's where the Yellow label really comes into it's own. Upfront we have a lot of warm caramel, vanilla and delightful bourbon spice.

There is a hint of char, oak, a wisp of citrus and that JD spice help liven things up.","palate":"Without that oily char character it's tasting much more like a traditional bourbon with caramel and vanilla sitting up front.
